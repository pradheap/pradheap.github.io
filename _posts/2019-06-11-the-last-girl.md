This is a harrowing account of the author's tormenting experience with ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant).

Nadia Murad, was a Yazidi girl from a small village called Kocho in Iraq. Their village was surrounded by ISIS for a few months and one day they were finally there, they wreaked a havoc in Kocho. They made everyone march to the local school and separated boys, men, women and girls. They killed the men and took the girls and women to a different location. The girls were usually sold for a few hundred dollars or were given to young recruits as rewards or just transacted around the militants themselves. In short, these women were used as like a commodity by the ISIS to fuel their economy.

Imagine you being plucked from your home, watched your loved ones executed, sold and bought in a market like a vegetable. Every one of the random militants you came across molested and raped you at every chance he got. And all of this was happening to you because you belong to a different religion and you were considered as a slave and simply you didn't have any rights. Generally the women's place (even Muslim women) was reduced to a very lowly position in an ISIS society. But ultimately the author managed to escape from the hands of ISIS with the help of a local Muslim family that lived within the ISIS controlled city. I can't help but think about all of the unfortunate girls and women that were unable to escape or failed to escape their captors. 

The author won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize and below is her moving speech.
