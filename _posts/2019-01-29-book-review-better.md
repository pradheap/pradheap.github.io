This is not going to be a comprehensive review. I did read 'Checklist Manifesto' from the same author and I liked it very much. So, I didn't even bother to read the description of the book when I picked it up and just went with the author's name (a perfect example of Halo effect!). The book seemed a little different to me than the 'Checklist Manifesto' in the sense this book delved deeper into diagnosis and surgery complications.  

This is not a self-help book in the stricter sense and to get the typical self-help juice out of it, one has to deeply compare and contrast the author's stories/anecdotes with what a reader typically does at his/her workplace or in any endeavor where he/she is just constantly thinking about getting better and better.
