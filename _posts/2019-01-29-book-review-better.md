This is not going to be a comprehensive review. I did read 'Checklist Manifesto' from the same author and I liked it very much. This book to me seemed different from that book in the sense this book delved deeper into diagnosis and surgery complications. But I didn't even bother to read the description of the book when I picked it up and just went with the author's name (a perfect example of Halo effect!). 

This is not a self help book in the stricter sense and to get the typical self help juice out of it, one has to deeply compare and contrast the author's stories/anectodes with what a reader typically does at his/her workplace or in any endeavor where he/she is just constantly thinking about getting better and Better.
