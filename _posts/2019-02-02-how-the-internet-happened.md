If reading a book can be compared to a bus ride, then this book is a speedy bus ride on the internet startups freeway stopping at some important upstarts and glancing over rest of the failed/successful startups both before and after the dot-com bubble. 

Our ride starts at Mosaic browser being developed as a research project and ends at Apple. <!-- (Todo: Come back and edit this line) --> We briefly stop at Mosaic, Netscape, AOL, Amazon, eBay, Etoys, TheGlobe, Napster, Google, Youtube, Netflix, Overture (goto.com), Yahoo, Wikipedia, Blogger, Friendster, AIM, MySpace, Facebook, Apple iTunes, Apple app store and also witness the famous browser war, dot-com burst, Google and Facebook's growth in between the stops.

Microsoft woke up late on the day when Internet came to the town and then tried to leverage their OS to catch up which ended in the famous browser war and as a result Bill Gates had to undergo a deposition before DOJ. On the other hand, AOL hosted an early party for the Internet and never wanted the Internet to leave its walled garden by trying to leverage their platform.

There were sites of all sorts that covered different niches before the dot-com burst. Also VCs were very eager to invest in these dot-com startups irrespective of whether these sites make profits. They were mainly interested in the the money fetched during the IPOs of such startups. Ultimately, when the bubble finally burst, NASDAQ lost nearly 80% of its value. A fine example is Etoys which was valued at $10 billion, can't even salvage $80 million for the warehouse system it had built. It is estimated that $1.7 trillion was lost.

At the end of the dot-com bubble, few internet based companies survived such as Amazon, Netflix, eBay and Yahoo!. Just before the dot-com bubble burst and after it, we see few new companies such as PayPal, Napster, Google, Youtube and MySpace. We see how Google started as a small project inside Stanford and becomes a behemoth because of few innovations and luck plus timing. Google founders realized that citation plays a major role in the academic papers and applied a similar concept for ranking web pages. You can read more [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090306075322/http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Google's significant innovation was this page rank technique that helped it to become a market leader in online search. 

Yahoo! had made a deal where they got 10% stake in Google when it was a small search engine and was offering search as a service to other partners. So the search in Yahoo! portal was powered by Google for some period of time. Google hit 100 million searches in 2001 with more than 1000 queries per second. Google had been growing so fast that it was unable to meet its financial needs just from the funding and the money it got from various search deals. It was looking for other avenues and running ads on the search engine result pages was one of the ideas.

We look at an obscure company called goto.com which was founded by Bill Gross and was later renamed to 'Overture'. GoTo was a search engine just powered by ads. Advertisers pay by bidding for a search term and pay per click were two key innovations of it. GoTo partnered with other search engines and displayed ads either on the top or bottom of the search results page. In 2000 Google launched 'Ad Words' and in February, 2002 it copies pay per click model and ad auction price model and added a small innovation to it by including a ranking factor for ads called as 'Quality Score'. Overture model had an issue in ad placements where the highest bidder takes the top spot. But with Google's quality score, only ads of higher quality ranked much higher regardless of the money an advertiser spent. Yahoo! later acquired GoTo in 2003 and later Google had to settle patent related lawsuits to Yahoo!. 

Google had 60% operating margin when they had their IPO. This was shocking to every other online companies and to the Wall Street. Google had a bigger market share in online advertising than any other online companies and continues to do so. Napster a file sharing website which facilitated sharing mp3 files among users had so many copyright lawsuits from the record labels and was shut down. Youtube which was a video sharing site had the same problem later. Google which acquired Youtube had a different stance on copyrights than Napster and was willing to 100% comply with the copyright laws. 

Next stop is Social Networking and we are introduced to a site called 'Six Degrees' which was named after the six degrees of separation concept and you can read it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation){:target="_blank"}. Then came Friendster which inspired a lot of other niche networking *ster sites like Dogster, Catster and Elfster. MySpace, also a friendster clone was created by eUniverse employees in 2003. In 2004, Facebook was created by Mark and were slowly rolling out to major universities and college campuses. In 2005, 'MySpace' rejected Mark's offer of $75 million deal to sell Facebook. Myspace grew in users and was later acquired by Rupert Murdoch for $580 million. Later Myspace was valued at $12 billion at its peak around 2007-2008 and then was sold for $32 million by Murdoch's News Corp.

Facebook managed to generate critical mass and was attracting users from other social networking sites as it was opened to public. Sean Parker (of Napster fame) helped Mark secure angel funding from Peter Theil and Reid Hoffman during the early days. 

Towards the end of the book, we look at mobile computing especially PDAs, pagers, BlackBerry and iPhones. BlackBerry was the first device where users where hooked to the device always and everywhere even during a conversation. This is the start of a different era where people are going to be always online and reachable. <!-- (Todo: This section to be expanded after completion) -->

This is a fun book and compresses nearly a 30 years of Internet's history. And every big company had its timing right, grew too fast, afraid of other big companies (Google fearing Microsoft. etc.,) and luck. It seems that every popular site offers a form of instant gratification and infinite selection. I can wish for something and its immediately delivered, I can decide to watch something and there is a million videos I can choose from. As I read in another book called 'Flow', we're increasingly becoming passive consumers of these sites and are not actively contributing or pursuing anything creatively. What were we doing before a mobile phone and these sites? Do any of us remember anymore?
