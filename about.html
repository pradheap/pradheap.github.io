    <h1>About Me</h1>
    </p>
	<p>
        Hello there, I'm Pradheap. I work as a Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA and live in Belmont, CA. I graduated in Mechatronics Engineering from <a href='https://www.tce.edu/' target="_blank">TCE</a> in the year 2007.
    </p><p>
        I primarily work with NodeJS and Python with AWS. I used to develop some applications on Java/J2EE frameworks long back.
    </p><p>
        I'm on <a href ='https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4987984-pradheap' target="_blank">Goodreads</a> too.
        I love reading non-fiction books on various subjects such as Psychology, Biology, Physics and History. Though I've read a couple of fictions like 'Godfather' and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', I prefer reading non-fiction minus self-help books in the hope of better understanding our complex world, organisms that inhabit this world and the cosmos.

        I'm a 3D printing enthusiast and I love 3D modeling. You can find my designs <a href='https://www.thingiverse.com/prad/designs' 
        target="_blank">here</a>. I own an Ultimaker 3D printer (the very first DIY kit version).

        I often create some websites just for fun. One such recent one is 
        <a href='https://www.textosaur.us/' target="_blank">Textosaur.us</a>, a site to manipulate text on the fly.
