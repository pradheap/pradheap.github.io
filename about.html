        Hey there, I'm Pradheap. I'm a Software Engineer and work in San Francisco, CA and live in Belmont, CA.
        I graduated in Mechatronics Engineering from <a href='https://www.tce.edu/' target="_blank">TCE</a> in the year 2007.

        Hey, I'm on <a href ='https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4987984-pradheap' target="_blank">Goodreads</a>.
        I love to read non-fiction books on various subjects like Psychology, Biology, Physics and History.
        I'm a 3D printing enthusiast and you can find my designs <a href='https://www.thingiverse.com/prad/designs' 
        target="_blank">here</a>. I own an Ultimaker 3D printer (the very first DIY kit version).
