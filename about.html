        Hey there, I'm Pradheap. I'm a Software Engineer who works at San Francisco, CA and lives in Belmont, CA.
        I graduated in Mechatronics Engineering from <a href='https://www.tce.edu/'>TCE</a> in the year 2007.

        Hey, I'm on <a href ='https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4987984-pradheap'>Goodreads</a>.
        I love to read non-fiction books on various subjects like Psychology, Biology, Physics and History.
        I can create 3D models and I own an ultimaker 3D printer (the very first kickstarter version).
        I'm a 3D printing enthusiast and you can find my designs 
        <a href='https://www.thingiverse.com/prad/designs'>here</a>.

        This is a space where I would express my thoughts.
        This site is developed using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
        and is hosted for free via GitHub.
        I often create some websites just for fun. One such recent one is 
        <a href='https://www.textosaur.us/'>Textosaur.us</a>, a site to mainpulate text on the fly.
